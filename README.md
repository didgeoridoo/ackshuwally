A Twitter bot to take pedants down a notch

## What's it do?
Sometimes, people can get a bit pedantic on the Twitters. This bot is designed to remind them that they're being dickish.

## How's it work?
The bot scans the public stream for tweet responses that start with "Actually," and checks to see if there is a 10x or greater differential in follower count between the Actualizer and the target — this tries to ensure that we're only butting in on conversations where someone is punching downwards. It then... adds to the conversation.

## Why?
Because I said I would. https://twitter.com/didgeoridoo/status/898935820295577600
